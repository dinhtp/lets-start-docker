# Let's Start Docker


## What to do
Let's dockerize with Docker. \
This repository is a complete beginner tutorial which helps you understand the fundamental concept behind Docker.
The repository divided into multiple sub directories, each directory will represent a tutorial of Docker.
Each tutorial will mainly focus on one specific topic of Docker. More information about learning objectives, 
resources and practice exercises (if any) will be provided in a `READEME.md` file. 


## How to use
### Learning objectives
The learning objectives, denoted by the **Objectives** heading, is an outcome statement of each tutorial. 
This section will help you understand the main topics of the tutorial, along with the knowledge and skills that need to
be acquired after finished.

### Learning resources
The learning objectives, denoted by the **Resources** heading, is the learning material of each tutorial. The material 
can be presented in many methods such as videos, documentations, examples, etc. As the first rule of thumb, 
you should always read from the top to the bottom. The last resource items will cover a wider 
range of knowledge from the topic that may require basic understanding from the first items.

### Practice Exercises
While going over the learning resources, you can practise using Docker based on the **Exercises** section of the `READEME.md` file.
There are many practice items that can help you utilize Docker to its full potential. Some may require you to push 
the Docker image to Docker Hub; therefore, if you do not have an account on Docker Hub, 
visit [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com) and create one.
